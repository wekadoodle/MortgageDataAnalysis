# Historical Mortgage Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing historical mortgage data using Python. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature selection, and statistical analysis. This work was completed as part of a project for my Big Data Analysis class.

## Project Description

The project aims to provide insights into mortgage data by performing various data analysis techniques. It involves combining quarterly data files, selecting relevant features, and checking for data consistency and unexpected values.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Freddie Mac's 2023 historical data. Due to size constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download the dataset directly from [Freddie Mac's official website](https://freddiemac.com).

## Setup

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Library Installation**: Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
   ```

## Usage

1. **Download the Dataset**: Obtain the dataset from Freddie Mac's website and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open and execute `[ISCS30_19]_Project_1.ipynb` to perform the analysis.

## Project Structure

- **`[ISCS30_19]_Project_1.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis.
- **`ISCS30.19.pdf`**: PDF document showing the results of the analysis.
